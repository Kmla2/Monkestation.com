  <div id="01" class="tabcontent">
    <p>
      This server has a zero tolerance policy for bigotry.<br><br>
      
      This includes racism, sexism, and homophobia, including in-character versions of it.
      Any usage of slurs, or methods to get around the filters is prohibited.
      Outside of that, we encourage you to treat your fellow spaceman with respect.<br><br>
      
      Preferably, no talk of IRL political events should happen either.
      Our station is supposed to be a fun place: Light hearted, goofy and full of farts.<br><br><br><br>

    
      <h1 style="color:rgb(216, 208, 208)"><b>Click each rule to see more information!</b></h1></p><br><br>
    <p></p>
    </div>
  <div id="02" class="tabcontent">
    <p>Do not do the job of another unless the department is unstaffed, requests assistance or is otherwise incapacitated.<br><br>
    
    Breaking into medbay storage, stealing supplies and just treating yourself does not provide interaction between players.
    Rushing into engineering to silently snatch up the gloves and tools deprives the rest of the engineers the equipment
    they need to survive.
    Making weaponry and zipties just for the sake of hunting down antagonists makes security redundant.<br><br>
    
    Play as the job you chose, or get the Head of Personnel/Captain to change it.
    Communicate for equipment if you need it.<br><br>
  
    MonkeStation is a server that promotes social interaction and has a number of newer players that are learning the roles
    themselves.
    Remember that you were new at one point as well, give them a chance to actually play and enjoy this game as well.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="03" class="tabcontent">
    <p>Monkestation is not a place for sexual content of any sort.
    This includes erotic role-play, sexual copypasta, references to genitalia and sexual acts.<br><br>
    
    There are other servers for that.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div id="04" class="tabcontent">
    <p>Out of game communications, cliques that mysteriously show up to silently save someone and usage of out of game
    information such as a stream to discover antagonist status are not permitted.
    However, we highly encourage teaching friends as we know SS13 is a very difficult game.
    Should you need to use out of game communications for that purpose, we simply ask that you make an adminhelp during
    rounds that you are teaching someone this way. Give the name of the person/people you are teaching in the adminhelp.<br><br>
    
    Metagrudging is the act of acting upon previous round info, such as refusing to heal someone because they were an
    antagonist last round.<br>
    <b>This is not permitted.</b><br><br>
    
    Do not speak about current round information in the OOC chat channel.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="05" class="tabcontent">
    <p>Monkestation is a streamer friendly server, with very minor rules for those that wish to stream here.
    No stream delay is required.<br><br>
    
    Metaknowledge is not permitted, chat members must not inform the streamer of things they could not have known.
    It's fine to point something out so long as it was visible on stream.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="06" class="tabcontent">
    <p>We know the face of this station definitely is in the gray area of this rule.
    Committing small crimes and building dangerous machines breathes life into an otherwise mundane round.
    Just do not cross the line into murder, theft of major items or destruction.<br><br>
    
    If you're ever wondering your gimmick is leaning too far into self antag territory, consider if you're negatively
    effecting another player's round.
    You can also adminhelp if you want our opinion on it as well. Coming to us willingly will be treated better than if we
    had to bwoink you.<br><br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="07" class="tabcontent">
    <p>Lowpop hours are a time for learning.<br>
    You are especially discouraged from self antagging and otherwise impeding other peoples experiences when the server's
    population is below 10.<br>
    On most very low-pop rounds, antagonists will not be spawning in general.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="08" class="tabcontent">
    <p>If you are not security, avoid vigilantism.
    Defending yourself is fine, but making your entire round goal to chase down and hunt the antagonists is not.<br><br>
    
    This also excludes a solid RP reason (within the round) for seeking revenge.
    A clown who has had their shoes stolen by security, a chef continually getting harassed by assistants or a doctor that
    keeps getting shoved by crew as they work all have reasons to fight back.<br><br>
    
    If there is a large-scale threat to the station, anyone is encouraged to participate in protecting the station.
    Large-scale threats are: Nuclear Operatives, Blobs, Xenomorphs and Wizards.</p>
  </div>
<div id="09" class="tabcontent">
  <p>Whether you are an antagonist or not, you must have some form of escalation for killing/wounding people and causing
  destruction.
  We are an RP server and silently dispatching your target is rarely interesting for anyone, so ensure you interact with
  them in some form.
  Your job as an antagonist is to make the round interesting rather than go for objectives. Be creative, admins will often
  assist with gimmicks.<br><br>
  
  Actively murdering an excessive amount of people outside of your objectives is not permitted, except if you are a
  Nuclear Operative, Blob, Xenomorph or Wizard.
  In cases where you are forced to defend yourself against aggression against yourself, that is permitted so long as you
  aren't obviously baiting for kills.</p>
</div>
<div id="10" class="tabcontent">
  <p>On MonkeStation, we have a very light policy around names that should still allow you to be creative or humorous if you
  so desire.<br>
  Names must not be references to any people that were politically relevant, figures that were involved in major real-life
  criminality, or be references to anything that would otherwise break rules 1 and 3.
  Examples of unacceptable names: "George Floyd", "Jeffery Epstein", "Bonerfart The Clown"<br><br>
  
  References to video games, shows, movies, books, or other fictional creations are perfectly acceptable so long as they
  would not break other rules.</p>
</div>
<div id="11" class="tabcontent">
  <p>Above all else, if an admin is telling you to stop doing something, stop doing it. Claiming "It's not in the rules!",
  arguing, and rules lawyering is not going to help your situation in the event of an admin PM. Additionally, dragging an
  admin's decision into other channels (Twitch, Discord) will not help your case and can result in additional time banned.<br><br>
  
  Also please remember: Admins are not omniscient or omnipresent: while they have a large arsenal of tools at their
  disposal to stop rule breakers, they aren't able to stop something before it happens. Please use the Adminhelp feature
  (F1) to report any rule breaking! Even if it's just a gut suspicion, its fine to just use this feature to have them
  check it out.<br><br>
  
  In lieu of this, please remember that admins are there for rules enforcement, not players. Please report and move on; do
  not antagonize the perpetrator in either In Character(IC) or Out Of Character(OOC) regarding the report; this doesn't
  help anyone, regardless of whether or not they're breaking the rules. Additionally, dogpiling is not cool. Let the
  admins take care of stuff.</p>
